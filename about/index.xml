      <description>MSF Makes is a collection of innovative projects and tools for you to replicate, improve, share and get involved with. These innovations can improve the way MSF works, and the care we provide to patients and communities.
They have been tried and tested in the field by doers, makers, inventors and problem-solvers just like you.
